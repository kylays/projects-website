# projects-website
This is a website created to host some personal projects I made for fun. It was 
started while taking CS 132 at Caltech as I was learning web development, and is 
updated with more cool things as I make them! To see the website locally, clone 
this repo and run `npm install` and `nodemon app.js`, then go to `localhost:8000/index.html`. 
Otherwise, direct your browser to https://kylays.github.io/projects-website/index.html or https://kylays-projects.herokuapp.com/.
